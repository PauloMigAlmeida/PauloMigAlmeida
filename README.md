### Hi there 👋. 

I'm a developer who is interested in open source software development, operating system development, Math, Data structures and virtualisation.

📚 **Medium blog:** https://deepdives.medium.com/

🤝 **Community work:** Owner of the [Auckland Data Structures and Algorithms Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Programming-Algorithms-and-Performance/)

🔭 **Currently working**: Writing a hobbyist x86-64 Operating System for the joy of learning about the hardware-to-software interface [AlmeidaOS](https://github.com/PauloMigAlmeida/AlmeidaOS).

🌱 **Currently learning** The Linux Kernel source code / x86-64 Architecture / C / Assembly

👯 **Looking to collaborate on** Any AWS-related subjects (I'm a former Solutions Architect @ AWS)

### Meaningful open source contributions:

* Created the first [AWS Lambda runtime for C lang (C11)](https://github.com/PauloMigAlmeida/aws-lambda-c-runtime). This provides negligible cold-start overhead (single digit millisecond).
* Added support for most of the GitHub Marketplace && Github App APIs to the [github-api](https://github.com/hub4j/github-api). Currently used at Jenkins integration with GiHub.

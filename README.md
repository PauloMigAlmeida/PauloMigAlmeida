### Hi there 👋. 

I'm a developer who is interested in open source software development, operating system development, Math, Data structures and virtualisation.

📚 **Medium blog:** https://deepdives.medium.com/

🤝 **Community work:** 
* Casual 🐧 Linux Kernel Driver commiter
* Former organiser of the [Auckland Data Structures and Algorithms Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Programming-Algorithms-and-Performance/)

🔭 **Currently working**: Writing NES emulator in Rust to learn both rust lang and emulation/virtualisation concepts [MaNES](https://github.com/PauloMigAlmeida/MaNES).

🌱 **Currently learning** The Linux Kernel source code / x86-64 Architecture / C / Assembly

👯 **Looking to collaborate on** Any AWS-related subjects (I'm a former Solutions Architect @ AWS)


### Favorite open source projects I created:

* Created the first [AWS Lambda runtime for C lang (C11)](https://github.com/PauloMigAlmeida/aws-lambda-c-runtime). This provides negligible cold-start overhead (single digit millisecond).
* Created my own hobbyist x86-64 Operating System [AlmeidaOS](https://github.com/PauloMigAlmeida/AlmeidaOS).
